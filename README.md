Canadian Per Capita Income Prediction
This repository contains the code and data for a simple linear regression model built to predict the per capita income in Canada based on historical data.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of two columns: 'Year' and 'Per Capita Income (CAD)'. The data spans multiple years and represents the per capita income in Canada over time.

Methodology
Model: Simple Linear Regression
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
Evaluation Metric: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Results
The trained model achieved a certain level of accuracy in predicting the per capita income for the years 2020 and 2024 based on the historical data.

Future Work
Explore more advanced machine learning algorithms for improved prediction accuracy.
Incorporate additional features or datasets to enhance the model's performance.
